 [ LICENSE ]

    Historically, gPodder was licensed under the terms of the "GNU GPLv2 or
    later", and has been upgraded to "GNU GPLv3 or later" in August 2007.

    Code that has been solely written by thp was re-licensed to a more
    permissive license (ISC license) in August 2013. The new license is
    DFSG-compatible, FSF-approved, OSI-approved and GPL-compatible (see
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license for more information).

    For the license that applies to a file, see the copyright header in it.

 [ WHAT IS THIS? ]

    This is the gPodder Core, including the core Python modules as well as
    the command-line interface "gpo". Since version 4, the user interfaces
    have been split out into different packages that can be found elsewhere:

      - QML UI: http://github.com/gpodder/gpodder-ui-qml

 [ DEPENDENCIES ]

    - Python 3.2 or newer              http://python.org/
    - podcastparser                    http://github.com/gpodder/podcastparser

 [ BUILD DEPENDENCIES ]

    - gettext

 [ TEST DEPENDENCIES ]

    - python3-nose
    - python3-minimock
    - python3-coverage

 [ TESTING ]

    To run tests, use...
        make tests

    Tests in gPodder are written in two different ways:

       - doctests      http://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest
       - unittests     http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest

    If you want to add doctests, simply write the doctest and make sure that
    the module appears in "doctest_modules" in src/gpodder/test/__init__.py.
    For example, the doctests in src/gpodder/util.py are added as 'util' (the
    "gpodder" prefix must not be specified there).

    If you want to add unit tests for a specific module (ex: gpodder.model),
    you should add the tests as test_gpodder.model, or in other words:

        The file       src/gpodder/model.py
        is tested by   tests/test_gpodder/model.py

    After you've added the test, make sure that the module appears in
    "test_modules" in tests/test_gpodder/__init__.py - for the example above,
    the unittests in tests/test_gpodder/model.py are added as 'model'. For unit
    tests, coverage reporting happens for the tested module (that's why the
    test module name should mirror the module to be tested).


 [ RUNNING AND INSTALLATION ]

    To run gPodder from source, use..

        bin/gpo                  for the command-line interface

    To install gPodder system-wide, use "make install". By default, this
    will install all translations. The following environment variables
    are processed by setup.py:

        LINGUAS                  space-separated list of languages to install
        GPODDER_MANPATH_NO_SHARE if set, install manpages to $PREFIX/man/man1

    See setup.py for a list of recognized UIs.

    Example: Install with German and Dutch translations:

        export LINGUAS="de nl"
        make install

    The "make install" target also supports DESTDIR and PREFIX for installing
    into an alternative root (default /) and prefix (default /usr):

        make install DESTDIR=tmp/ PREFIX=/usr/local/


 [ PORTABLE MODE / ROAMING PROFILES ]

    The run-time environment variable GPODDER_HOME is used to set
    the location for storing the database and downloaded files.

    This can be used for multiple configurations or to store the
    download directory directly on a MP3 player or USB disk:

        export GPODDER_HOME=/media/usbdisk/gpodder-data/


 [ CHANGING THE DOWNLOAD DIRECTORY ]

    The run-time environment variable GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR is used to
    set the location for storing the downloads only (independent of the
    data directory GPODDER_HOME):

        export GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/media/BigDisk/Podcasts/

    In this case, the database and settings will be stored in the default
    location, with the downloads stored in /media/BigDisk/Podcasts/.

    Another example would be to set both environment variables:

        export GPODDER_HOME=~/.config/gpodder/
        export GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR=~/Podcasts/

    This will store the database and settings files in ~/.config/gpodder/
    and the downloads in ~/Podcasts/. If GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR is not set,
    $GPODDER_HOME/Downloads/ will be used if it is set.


 [ LOGGING ]

    By default, gPodder writes log files to $GPODDER_HOME/Logs/ and removes
    them after a certain amount of times. To avoid this behavior, you can set
    the environment variable GPODDER_WRITE_LOGS to "no", e.g:

        export GPODDER_WRITE_LOGS=no
